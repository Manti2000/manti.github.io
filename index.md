# About

I am a full time Game Developer currently working on [Vagrus - The Riven Realms](https://vagrus.com). 
I have also worked on [Chicken Police: Into The Hive](https://chickenpolice.com) and [Moses and Plato: Last Train To Clawville](https://mosesandplato.com).

Recently I started crafting scripts for the Unity Asset Store to maybe ease the life of some Unity devs out there. You can them below.
