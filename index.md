# About

I am a full time Game Developer currently working on: 
* [Vagrus - The Riven Realms](https://vagrus.com).

I have also worked on:
* [Chicken Police: Into The Hive](https://chickenpolice.com)
* [Moses and Plato: Last Train To Clawville](https://mosesandplato.com).

Recently I started crafting scripts for the Unity Asset Store to maybe ease the life of some Unity devs out there. You can check them out below.

## Scriptable Enums

Are you tired of always having to open your script editor only for editing enums? Are you not a programmer and you don't want to edit the code?

With Scriptable Enums you **no longer have to open** your IDE software to edit your enums, or even to just create them! You can **edit it all from the Scriptable Enum Object** containing your enum!

#### **All you need to do is:**
1. Create the Scriptable Enum object
2. Enter the enum name you wish to edit
3. Rearrange, add or remove from the elements or modify them however you like
4. Save
5. Done!

### Details:

* Create **multiple** Scriptable Enum objects, each containing a different enum (or the same)
* **Rename** enum elements
* **Change** enum values
* **Rearrange** element order
* The editor **checks** for **name and value collision** between elements, so you don't have to
* **Generate** a totally **new enum script** from the Scriptable Enum object itself
* Enum script **implementation can be anywhere**, in any script file. It can be edited as long as the enum is public and takes place in the assemblies used by Unity (e.g. AssemblyCSharp) or created by the user

#### You can get it from the Untiy Asset Store [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/293803)
